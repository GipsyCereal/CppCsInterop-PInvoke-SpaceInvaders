# CppCsInterop-PInvoke-SpaceInvaders
Sometimes, we want code that has been written and compiled in different programming languages to communicate with each other. The Unity engine, for example, is written in C++, but the editor application UI is written in C#.

​

Unity exposes a .NET API so that not every programmer is required to write their game in C++, but in C# instead.

​

As I am aspired to become an engine developer in the future I thought it paramount to at least learn the fundamentals of C++/C# interop marshalling unmanaged C++ data to managed C# with a C wrapper.

​

The space invaders logic is simple, yet it taught me much about PInvoke interoperability.
